# my_leetcode_record
a record of my work in leetcode for better to review, mostly you can run it on your local IDE.
i have done about 300 algorithm problem in leetcode, but recently i meet some problem which i had learned some trcks but forgot it quickly, maybe i need a place to record my work to review them timely from now on. take it seriously, foget means learning in vain.
